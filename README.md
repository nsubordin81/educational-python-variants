# Blueprints for a Serpent - educational-python-variants
exploration of different python implementations

## Repo Navigation

- The [Research](Research.md) markdown page contains a cleaned up version of notes I took when digging into this topic

- There are directories in the repo for some of the more popular python implementations (with the 
notable exception of cPython). They may not all have code samples but each should have at least a description 
and some scorecard information talking at a high level about their motivations, features, side benefits, and limitations.
If you are interested in contributing more implementation versions, let me know and I can add you as a contributor!

- In some cases, there will be code samples in the directories demonstrating usage of the target implementation. In 
these cases the readme in that directory will attempt to provide adequate instructions for how to set up and run the 
demonstrations.
