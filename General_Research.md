## Implementation V. Specification

Language specifications are the documentation of what it means to write a program in that language, so that implementors of the language can have consensus on what is and is not part of the language. ("Programming Language Specification")

Implementations are how languages end up being coded so they can be used. Usually there is one implementation that is the most widely used and accepted version, the reference implementation. Changes to the semantics and syntax of a language represent and update to the specification. In Python's case, these changes are reflected in the versions of its language reference which mirror the version of its reference implemenation, CPython.

### Helpful Analogies

I have a couple of useful analogies that helped me with the difference between specification and implementation, feel free to skip this next part if you're already familiar:

1. The Function Interface: The first is the analogy of specifications as an interface like that of a function's interface. Just like a function's 
interface says what its inputs and expected outputs are but leaves the concrete to the body of the function, so does a specification leave the implementation details to the various implementations. 

This is not a perfect analogy. It is probably an oversimiplification of languages to model them as one function from inputs to outputs. The range of possible inputs and expected outputs for a lanugage is usually huge in scope. Also, a language consititutes the very magic words that functions are defined with, so the analogy continues to break down. While it is probably possible to reframe a language's specification as a formal function definition in some kind of psuedo code or mathematical notation and we might learn a great deal from that exercise, going down this path is less and less useful as a quick reference for you to think about language specifications.

2. The Blueprint: The second analogy is to that of blueprints for a building or for an engineering project. This analogy fits both better and worse than the function interface.

Analogy 2 is Better in the sense that buildings are unlikely to fully match their blueprints. There isn't the expectation that you will take something from the written page and have all the knowledge you need to construct a building or bridge with it. Many things are left up to the builder. She can choose different materials, make more drastic alterations, change the invisble parts and provide benefits to the would be users of what she is building just so long as she stays true to the vision of what the blueprints were aiming for. 

Analogy 2 is worse because the building or rocket that results is a physical, tangible thing that has to deal with the constraints of being manifest in the world so designers and builders have to be less tolerant of certain kinds of deviations from their design that might not be true for languages, and so in that way the functional interface example was better.

Nevertheless, I'd argue that these analogies both work for the core idea which is concrete implementations of a language can have variety with respect to their specifications, and just as with functions, different implementations can change factors outside of their interface, such as 
how fast they run, how reliable they are, whether or not they rely on lower level building blocks to get the job done, etc. 

There is a great third description of this idea in the Python language reference itself 

"While I am trying to be as precise as possible, I chose to use English rather than formal specifications for everything except syntax and lexical analysis. This should make the document more understandable to the average reader, but will leave room for ambiguities. Consequently, if you were coming from Mars and tried to re-implement Python from this document alone, you might have to guess things and in fact you would probably end up implementing quite a different language. On the other hand, if you are using Python and wonder what the precise rules about a particular area of the language are, you should definitely be able to find them here. If you would like to see a more formal definition of the language, maybe you could volunteer your time â€” or invent a cloning machine :-)."  - probably Guido Van Rossum, python language reference https://docs.python.org/3/reference/introduction.html#alternate-implementations

### Listing Of Python Implementations Compliant With Some Version Of The Language

While CPython is the de facto standard implementation for implementing Python, Python.org has a list of what it recognizes as alternative implementations of the python specification, which includes IronPython, Jython, Pypy, Stackless Python, and Micro Python https://www.python.org/download/alternatives/.

### Standardization 

Some languages have gone the route of having a standards body actually maintain a standardization for their language. 
Some prominent standards organizations that perform this are ANSI, ISO, ECMA, and IEEE. A (probably not comprehensive) list of 
languages that have been standardized by these orgs includes:<sup>8</sup>
- Ada
- APT (a numerical control language)
- Basic
- C
- C++
- C#
- Cobol
- Common Lisp
- Dart
- Dibol
- Eiffel
- Forth
- Fortran
- Javascript
- Mumps/M
- PANCM
- Pascal
- PL/B (aka Databus)
- PL/I
- Rexx
- Ruby
- Smalltalk, SQL

and more as shown here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages 

Python's standard is maintained apart from these organizations as described below. The rigor of the ANSI and ISO standards is criticised by some because the languages become so stable they fail to be open to changes from the outside. For a low level language like C this may very well be appropriate, but that is one of the advantages of Python's niche. 

### Python's Programming Language Specification

case Python's specification is the Python language reference and lives here: https://docs.Python.org/3/reference/index.html<sup>5</sup>

Note that the very first section in the reference implementation points out that everything except for syntax and lexical analysis is described in natural language, and that this is intentional for readability. It also alludes to the idea that two different people might create a different language just looking at the spec.

The document also mentions that CPython is the widespread reference implementation and implementation notes are provided throughout the document where special considerations having to do with that implementation.

So CPython is the 'de facto' implementation of Python, but even in CPython's case there are implementation details that get in the way of the abstract definition of the language that the Python Language Reference attempts to provide. And, arguably, that's a good thing because it means CPython and the other implementations aren't fully constrained by these standards.

### History of Python's specification<sup>2, 3, 4</sup>

Guido Van Rossum shared the code first time Feb 1991 0.9.0. The original language was in some ways a reaction to limitations in the languages he was working with at the time (ABC not extensible, Amoeba system calls not accessible from Bourne shell or C scripts), which may partly explain why Python's design is so extensible that we have alternative implementations surfacing. ("General Python FAQ")

From that time, the Python community has been involved but also guided by Van Rossum, and several mechanisms have come about as a process for enhancing the language. the semantic versioning has remained in place, with Major.Minor.Release(+, a0) as is commonplace to find on many software projects now. Each of these versions may require an upgrade to the overall language specification. This is why if you go to the language reference page you can select from the most recent release version of each minor version of Python to read a version of the reference tailored to that version of the CPython language. ("General Python FAQ")

There is a lot of history on the evolution of Python and lots of archives of conversations because of the high community involvement from the beginning. You can access these archives or even join the original UseNet group comp.lang.python. For example, the decision to do a major version upgrade of Python from 2 to 3 that had some non-backwards compatible changes to, amongst other things, remove redundant paths to the same functionality. Not really in scope for this research but all of these docs are fairly easy to find, either linked to Python.org or published elsewhere. also, here is an article covering some significant upgrades between Python 2 and 3 major versions: https://powerfulpython.com/blog/whats-really-new-in-python-3/

On the language development side there is also a tracking mechanism for enhancement requests that is open to the developer community and members of the public to read Python Enhancement Proposals (PEP).  These can be informational but are generally proposals for changes to the language, with specific language about what would be required and what the benefits would be.  https://www.Python.org/dev/peps/<sup>6</sup>

### difference between a language specification (a.k.a standard or definition) and a specification language?

This is somewhat of a non-sequitor, but for those who might have been confused about the similar naming like I was, Specification languages are languages created for determining program correctness. (Tucker and Noonan) if I write a program that is supposed to add to numbers and return their sum, a specification language would provide me a way to prove that the program will find the sum correctly for any valid inputs.

So the difference could be simply described as "one tells you how language A is supposed to implemented, another tells you whether a program in language A was implemented correctly"

## Important language design considerations
(For this whole section, knowledge of how compilation and interpretation work was sourced from  Tucker and Noonan)

Discussions of how an implemented language transforms source code into running programs, 

### Syntax

Answers the question, how do I know this program's structure is correct? What words are ok and where can I put them?

In language design, syntax definition is mostly accomplished through context free grammars (CFGs). The Grammars are a concise way to specify the full set of possible combinations of symbols that a program will consider valid.

### Names and Types

What is the vocabulary of the language? How does the language bind names, how does scoping work?  What are the values that a program can perform operations on, a.k.a the types? what kind of type system is made available for language users so they can understand how to write operations, how can the language protect users from making mistakes through its knowledge of types?

### Semantics

Just like in natural language, semantics are the meaning of the programming statements. When a statement is executed, what does it mean? What actually happens to the variables during an assignment? How are expressions evaluated? As covered in (Tucker and Noonan), There is a lot of value in building Semantic models that aren't tied to one particular choice of machine, and Python accomplishes this with its interpreted bytecode.

### High Level Steps (Tucker and Noonan again, remember, this whole section)

Lexical analysis (tokenization and validation of symbols based on grammar, and removal of unnecessary symbols)
  |
Syntax analysis (use the language's grammar to build the sequence of instructions into a more concise and less varied form called an abstract syntax tree)
  |
Semantic Analysis (go from an abstract syntax tree down to either an intermediate representation in the case of python/java, or to a non-optimized 


## Why Are There Interesting Python Alternatives? 

Some (subjective) theories were discussed in other sections, but will repeat them here and elaborate for good measure:

- Guido Van Rossum wanted a general purpose programming language that was extensible as an early goal of 
  Python in the 1990s. (sources python.org history page and interview with Van Rossum)
    - CPython as the reference implementation doesn't stop others from dreaming of other ways for interpretation, compilation and hardware virtualization to happen
- Python has had strong community support from the beginning, developers fall in love with how expressive and simple it is, so they would rather rewrite it than use another language
- Python is deemed a Higher Level Language (HLL) by most.
    - HLLs tend to be interpreted. Python is interpreted in a similar manner to Java and C# even though compilation happens at runtime. Having this intermediate bytecode format along with the accesibility of the compilation modules like the lexer, parser, abstract sytnax generator and disassembly, Python has allowed potential implementers the ability to come in at any point in the process and introduce an alternative that changes the way the runtime works.
    - interpreted languages tend to also be slower than compiled and statically typed languages, so other implementations can come in to try and close that gap
- The Python community likes to keep their standard reference implementation familiar and carefully control its feature set, but they also embrace the existence of other implementations of the language


### Performance

#### GIL, concurrency and parallelism

stackless Python and tasklets allow for massive cooperative asynchronous concurrency without parallelism. (source)

State of concurrency and parallelism in Python is that it has had support for concurrency with threads for some time and there have been significant upgrades to it in 3.2 and up https://wiki.python.org/moin/Concurrency, as well as async/await that came around 3.5.
Python is also able to support multi core parallelism through multiprocessing. There is even support for reactive streams in python through RxPy. It seems as though you need to be more conscious of what type of concurrency you are aiming to do than with other languages as the GIL is still a concern.

There have been some attempts to remove the GIL in Pypy https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2017/08/lets-remove-global-interpreter-lock.html

A talk on concurrency in python ://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zinZmE3Ogk&t=746s and concurrency in general. Some good points made in it:
- for a lot of programs, you're either small enough to do everything on one core, or you are so big that you need distributed computing. So as much as multithreaded concurrency and parallelism seem like the rule, they might be the exception for a lot of use cases. 
- When you do need to maximize the cores on your CPU, you can use somethign like the multiprocessor package when you need parallelism, just have separate processes that have their own address space and their own GIL. There are even patterns for mixing multiprocessing with async concurrency, I'm not sure how tricky that gets though.
- Multiprocessing is not going to be as efficient as multithreading because threads can put things in and take things out of memory with no overhead and share state and processes cannot. 
- The Async module takes away a lot of the costs of using threads for single core concurrency, but there is a lot of additional code you need to learn to write and refactor out of your existing codebase to use it properly. That being said, if you use threading wrong, the kinds of difficult to observe bugs you'll get make taking the time to learn async properly worthwhile.

More on this from the Python Docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrency.html , https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html?highlight=async#module-asyncio

### Interoperability

Sometimes it is desirable to embed python scripts inside of a slightly lower level language like Java or C#, have Python compile to something that a Javascript engine could execute, or have a python program that can make calls to libraries and assembly files from other languages. When this level of fusion is useful, there are Python implemenations
specifically designed to accomplish it like IronPython, Jython, Python.NET, PyJS and RubyPython. I have notes on Jython and IronPython in their folders. 

### Types

Compilation with type checking for speed has not been historically high on the list for standard python, but Cython
is being used for essentially this, compiling a python superset language that gives you tools for manual type declaration and optimization options down to optimized C instructions. Numba is another compiler that aims to do this, though instead of compilation it is interpreted and uses llvm and jit to speed up segements of your code. A good comparison is on this blog post: http://stephanhoyer.com/2015/04/09/numba-vs-Cython-how-to-choose/

Also of interest to the topic of typing would be Guido Van Rossum's talk on the approach to typing in python 3 at PyCon 2015 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wDvzy6Hgxg&t=1012s . This approach at the time was being considered internally for program correctness and other concerns type systems could assist with more than it was about speed, and it was being conducted independently of the influence of alternative python implementations.

## Is Python alone with this branching behavior? What about Java, C#, C++, Javascript, Ruby, etc. which have been around a while? 

Other languages do have alternate implementations, Python is not unique in this aspect. However, Python may be unique in that it celebrates this fact somewhat, 
is proud of the malleability of its spec to the extent that the official Python documentation mentions alternatives and Guido Van Rossum has called out implementations such as Pypy or Cython as existing solutions to performance gaps in CPython like the example here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wDvzy6Hgxg&t=1012s .. 

Other languages like Java have alternate implementations, and for some of the same reasons. More often than not, these alternative implementations are just trying to enable a different group of users than the reference implementation is trying to serve, like people coding for browsers, embedded devices, coming from other languages, or looking for higher performance. Here are some reasons for and links to either complete alternate implementaitons or at least partial alternatives ( different compiler, interpreter, etc.) for other languages: 

- Java<sup>7</sup>
    - As Java became more commercial and closed over the years by Sun and Oracle, open source implementations (e.g. OpenJDK) offer a way to use Java without the licensing and litigation concerns
    - There are many compilers and transpilers both open source and proprietary that compile bytecode to a machine code specialized for a target architecture
    - just like Pypy, Java has implementations that are looking at performance boosts from JIT compilers (source)
    - Also similar to Pypy, there is a JVM written in Java (source)
- JavaScript
    - ECMAScript is the specification, and there are a variety of different 'engines' acting as interpretors for Javascript, a lot more probably than Python generally https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ECMAScript_engines
- Most of these implementations are either for browser specific interfaces, smaller footprint interpreters for embedded JS and IoT devices, JIT compilation and GraalVM supports interoperability for languages. And then there's webassembly. . . so Python isn't totally alone in very innovative offshoots, but with the ubiquitousness of JS maybe this was inevitable.
- Ruby
    - there are several implementations of Ruby. As a close cousin of Python at least in its layer of abstraction at runtime, Ruby seems to have a similar list of offshoots. Many of them are also now defunct, but there are some that are still actively maintained and these generally look to be supporting interoperabiliy with ruby and other languages or at least supporting cross compilation of Ruby so it can be run as bytecode or machine lanugage. Rubinius is an interesting attempt to do what Pypy does for Python by writing an interpreter in Ruby, it is still porting over from C++ as of this writing it looks like.
- C# 
    - C# has an official standard referred to as the Common Language Infrastructure and a specification documentation site defined microsoft's page: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/introduction, so does it have alternate implementations? 
    - Before I answer, just to keep you in suspense, some news on the reference implementation front for C#: it looks like they just recently open sourced their compiler code both for the higher level Roslyn Compiler and also RyuJIT, lower level just in time compiler to translate from their intermediate language to machine code. Those are standard to .NET Core https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-ryujit-transition-is-complete/
    - OK, now I will answer. Yes, there are alternative implementations, though I don't see a lot of them. C# has been more proprietary for longer than the other languages on this list, so that could explain why there aren't as many, and why the few that do exist are either trying to open up usage to non-proprietary use cases (Mono, very behind the latest .NET Core versions but used by big names like Unity), or cross platform support (Elements toolchain, Xamarin) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)#Implementations

## What Are Less Drastic Things You Can Do Than Reimplementing?

### C, C++, Fortran Extensions

You can write extensions to Python in C, C++ and even Fortran (though I didn't look into this last one very much). In addition to giving 
you speed, it enables you to define new built in Python types and also make C system calls within your code. 

However, rather than writing these extensions in C/C++, which has its own set of documentation on docs.Python.org, https://docs.Python.org/3/extending/extending.html python docs advise that you use one of the higher level tools like Cython and Numba that allow you to write these extensions in a simpler and more familiar python syntax and let the tools do the hard work of building them and extensions that can be dynamically linked to the python interpreter 

### Explore Modules, Frameworks and Platforms

There is an appetite for Python in the scientific community, maybe because it is a fully featured language that is easy to work with without a lot of fuss, you can get something up and running quickly and iteratively with it. As a result, the community using Python for scientific applications have made a lot of efforts towards making Python run faster either by overcoming its limitations or extending it with new libraries that are highly optimized for the types of operations that are typically performed. 

There is a suite of packages like SciPy, Numpy, and Pandas, that rely on optimized math libraries like Linear Algebra Package (LAPACK) and Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) (source at bottom), and also perform clever optimizations like safely suspending the Global Interpreter Lock and writing thread safe C code for some operations (https://thomasnyberg.com/releasing_the_gil.html) and using indexing for additional speed for the dataframe data structure (source): https://developer.ibm.com/languages/Python/articles/ba-accelerate-Python/

### Newer Python Features For Concurrency and Parallelism

Core CPython has also made additions to its concurrency support in the standard library in Python 3+ to give you asynchronous capabilities for operations like I/O and also the multiprocessor package that gets around the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) by going up one level to spawn new processes and different CPU cores that each have their own GIL.

## Why would you take the reimplementing Python or using Python variant approach over something that just works with CPython?

### CPython just doesn't have the feature and you think it should

Stackless Python and Pypy are both good examples of this. Stackless was and effort to create a Python language that would support continuations. Here's some interesting remarks around that: http://wiki.c2.com/?StacklessPython. 

Pypy was conceived from the desire to be 'Python written in Python'. It achieved Python written in a slightly restricted rPython, but also has achieved much more, like an interpreter that can generate just-in-time compilers for dynamic languages other than Python. https://rPython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

### Using the other implementation saves you from having to write custom code

Cython is a great example of this, it allows you to write extensions in Python that is only slightly modified, so you don't have to 
go through the process of learning to write them in C/C++

If you can achieve significant performance boosts with Pypy and your code is at the right Python version then this can save you from 
having to write extensions in the first place

If you have a main application built in Java or c# and you want to provide the ability for people to script plugins or 
other features in an older version of Python, then Jython or IronPython could be a good fit. In this case you really want interoperability
between the languages without having to deal with message transfer and handcoding a lot of serialization and deserialization yourself

### You can use alternate implementations to better your understanding of how Python works and is implemented

Pypy's interpreter is written in CPython, buy CPython's is written in C and is much more verbose, yet their implementation behavior matches in most cases. So, 
you could look to Pypy as a more approachable way to learn about how Python works under the hood.

## Why Wouldn't You Switch Implementations To One Of These Whenever You Need Their Features?

The high level advice here, especially in a team setting or when writing code that will be maintained by others, is the same as you might here
for bringing in a new third party library. Do your homework on them. Are they mature? Do they really fit your use case? Will they still be around in a few years? 
How much support do they have? Will it take longer or add overhead for others to learn to code for it?  Does it have a reputation for failing in unexpected ways for the type of work you expect to be doing?

One thing that is probably common to all of these alternate Pythons is just lack of support for recent language features. If one part of your application could really benefit from just in time compilation speedup but another part relies on a 3.9 feature, as if this writing you can't have both with Pypy. Similarly for stackless, but if you are doing concurrency on a massive scale and don't mind missing out on some newer features then maybe you don't mind ;)

Alternative implementations may also just not behave the way in which you would expect if using them in place of CPython, becauase in addition to being compatible with CPython versions, they need to be compatible with c extensions and packages that are built to work with CPython. You generally just don't get guarantees that the community supporting your implementation is going to catch the wide variety of special cases that can come up 

This actually becomes even more pronounced with the interoperability versions. Jython and IronPython are both only up to version compatibility with CPython 2.7 at the time of this writing in 2021, which means they only have support for versions of Python which are considered officially deprecated by the Python community, no longer receiving support or security updates

The notable exceptions to most of this advice for both performance and interoperability are Cython and Pypy. Even though Cython offers more reassurance than guarantee that it will be able to compile compatible python code, it is not really as crucial, because its goal is to make it easier for your to write something that will run almost as fast as C. The regular Python interpreter and VM would then be able to have your Python code call the precompiled extensions you write and generally they seem to work. Pypy is an exception because it has a strong development support community and actually works under a grant system to have developers bring the language up to compatibility standards with CPython quickly. It will lag, but not as much. 

So when it comes to switching implementations just for a performance boost or because you want to interface with other language modules, the advice I have is to really consider whether your use case is isolated enough that your decision to go with another implementation won't paint you into a corner. For language interoperability, you can stay at the output level and write a translation layer with some common messaging format, for performance, you could optimize your code or write a c extension. 

## Why doesn't Python Just Adopt Alternate Implementations That Provide Such Nice Features? 

I'm sure the Python developer community would have very detailed and pointed reasons for each of the alternate implementations we've covered. My view on this after studying it a fair bit is this: generally, alternative implementations of Python are willing to substantially change core parts of the language's implementation in order to get one very cool feature. If the changes were less drastic, then these wouldn't be alternate implementations, they'd be modules, frameworks or some other type of extension. if you are a Python language developer, you already have a lot of things to be concerned with, such as not introducing incompatible changes, and continuing to support features that rely on the existing interpreter and VM.

Most of the alternative implementations require changing the bytecode and vm that the interpreter uses or modifying something else core to the language (dependency on the C stack in the case of stackless). While these have stabilized into their own usable forms, maintainers of the language would be dealing with a lot of new complexity and fundamental shifts in the language if they were to bring in these features. It could also break CPython's compatibility with other python variants that already exist. For example, this PEP on Generators throws out a cautionary note that going stackless could break the semantics of the Jython interpreter: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255/. That doesn't stop stackless from being under consideration as PEPs though, it is just more likely that they will either be deferred indefinitely or you'll see a more consensus driven form of them incorporated down the line (greenlets could be thought of as an example of this for Stackless Python, and maybe we'll eventually se a JIT compiler introduced into CPython)

## What are some interesting implementations?

Python.org and the language reference docs both list what python considers to be compatible alternative implementations to the python programming language https://www.python.org/download/alternatives/ https://docs.python.org/3/reference/introduction.html#alternate-implementations. Note that Cython is not covered here, being both a restricted python language as well as one more geared towards compiling extensions than python programs. Numba is likely also excluded for the same reason, but there are also others omitted because they aren't deemed to meet the specification corresponding to any specific python version. Here is a more broad list of alternate languages as well as interpreter and compiler variations: 

more comprehensive list of python implementations https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonImplementations
list of python compiler projects over the years: https://github.com/pfalcon/awesome-python-compilers

## Can you mix and match?

Yeah you can in some cases! For example, you could have multiple runtime environments that are optimized for performance in different ways, like some code that is written in CPython with C extensions that you compiled in Cython, and another portion that is written in Pypy that maybe has C extensions compiled to work with it, and running in stackless mode because maybe it needs multitasking also. It really depends on your use case

## What are their limitations?

### They are often behind the curve of version upgrades, maintained by a much smaller community

The changes made to the implementation may diverge so much with CPython that if there is a problem, you can't rely on the community of CPython developers to fix it. You also can't expect newer Python \ features to make it to these implementations with the same speed that they hit the reference implementation

### CPython is more stable and general purpose

CPython as the reference implementation has more people using it for more things. It keeps its compatibility up with third party modules and highly used C extensions. Even Pypy, one of the most used alternate implementations, can not keep up with this level of reliability for all usage scenarios

### Most of them put some constraint on how you write your Python

Pypy uses RPython because the interpreter needs a little more hinting to do its JIT generation magic. Cython needs type declarations so it can compile down to C. Stackless doesn't use the c stack, so in some ways that is a departure from the way you might think about how function execution is handled, even if the runtime stack is an unnecessarily restrictive structure as Stackless advocates will claim
